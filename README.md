**Asteroids (WIP)**

A classic arcade-style shooter built with Pygame. Destroy incoming asteroids by rotating your ship and firing projectiles. Inspired by Atari's iconic *Asteroids*.

---

## 🚀 Features (In Progress)

* **Ship Movement**: Rotate and thrust the ship using realistic inertia.
* **Shooting**: Fire shots that split asteroids on impact.
* **Asteroid Splitting**: Large asteroids break into smaller pieces.
* **Screen Wrap**: Objects wrap around screen edges seamlessly.
* **Scoring**: Track points for destroying asteroids by size.
* **Game Over**: Ends when your ship collides with an asteroid.

## 🎯 Roadmap

*These features are coming depending on the time I have available:*

* Add a scoring system
* Implement multiple lives and respawning
* Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
* Add acceleration to the player movement
* Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
* Add a background image
* Create different weapon types
* Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
* Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
* Add a shield power-up
* Add a speed power-up
* Add bombs that can be dropped


## ▶️ Usage

Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Controls

* **Left/Right arrows**: Rotate ship
* **Up arrow**: Thrust forward
* **Spacebar**: Fire shot
